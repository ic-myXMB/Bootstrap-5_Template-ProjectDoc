ProjectDoc | A Documentation Template in Bootstrap 5

 Description: A basic Bootstrap 5 single page Starter Template shared simply "AS IS" as a base starting point for any desired project pkg and demo documentation inclusions.

 About: This simple project was created simply after thinking on past various projects involved with over the years and how often times much time was spent on creating related documentation files that became rather bloated in the dist pkg with various internally included related files for such and or how often times said documentation files varied from pkg to pkg let alone the time spent often creating such from scratch on each project and then further time after such creating the documentation content within such, thus after thinking on such I wanted to simply try out creating a simple one page bootstrap documentation file base if ever needed that would have functionality for example to share standard documentation content as well as if needed share code snippets that the end user could quickly select and copy while reading said documentation. The desire for said file was that it as a base file could be quickly edited to reflect a specific current project and rather than internally link related files that increase overall dist pkg size, instead externally link any dependent files thus cutting down documentation file size within a desired dist pkg. The desire also with this project was simply also to allow for this file to act as a sort of landing page also so that such a file could be used as initial pkg documentation and alos then be used as the landing page to a project demo files or what not. As such this was a quick and basic attempt result done rather quickly on such concept.
